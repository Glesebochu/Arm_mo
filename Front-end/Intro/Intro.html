            Welcome to Armmo!
            <br><br>
            It's intuitive to assume you're interested in meditation, which is why you're here. Whether you're a
            beginner, a master, or an intermediate practitioner, being here means you've encountered or will encounter
            common challenges.

        </section>
        <section class="generalIntro2">
            Have you ever asked yourself, "Am I truly progressing ?" </section>
        <section class="generalIntro1">
            If so, you're not aloneâ€”I've asked myself this question too. I attempted to answer it by keeping a ledger of
            what I considered important meditative experiences during and after my meditation sessions. However, this
            approach didn't last long; I eventually found myself unable to maintain it. Interrupting my meditation to
            log experiences and calculate how long my mind wandered proved unappealing.
        </section>
        <section class="generalIntro2">
            Can you imagine a much easier, better way to do this ? One that doesn't require constant attention ?
        </section>
        <section class="generalIntro1">
            Without a doubt, it's thanks to this question that we remembered to build Armmo. Now, you can save all your
            data while meditating, without needing to shift your focus. You can achieve this level of efficiency while
            only realizing you've been playing a fun game.
