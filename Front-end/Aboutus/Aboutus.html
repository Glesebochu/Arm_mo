   <!-- Who are we ?
        Glesebochu is a team of individuals that aim to CREATE the
        grandest REALITIES through all of our projects.
       Our Dream for Arm'mo
        We made Arm’mo to aid as a mirror to self, so that a player can
        see reality as it truly is by practicing the art of being present.
        Through this window we seek to inspire a higher level of consciousness in the hearts
        of whomever
        finds their way to it. It is our mainhearted desire for this
        game to fuel your
        journey towards AWAKENING & beyond.

     About Game
        Welcome to Arm’mo, where we keep track of your meditation history. We understand that a significant challenge
        faced by many meditators is maintaining a regular and accurate record of their meditative experiences. For this
        reason, we have implemented functional systems that automatically save and display all your meditation data at
        the
        click of a button. In addition to analyzing meditation data, Arm’mo also functions as a meditation guide. To
        achieve this, we have incorporated the grand meditation principles from "The Mind Illuminated" by Culadasa John,
        a
        magnificent book on meditation practice.

        As a result, the game's user interface (UI) features a very intuitive dialogue sequence that players can
        undertake
        to represent their conscious experience and focus their minds. This process applies the preparation and
        transition
        phases extensively discussed in the book. Players can also progress through the 10 stages of the road to
        mastery,
        with each stage considered mastered based on the player's performance. For more information on these phases and
        stages, click on the link below.

        In simple terms, Arm’mo is a digital ledger and meditation guide that enhances the transformative nature of each
        of your meditation sessions.
