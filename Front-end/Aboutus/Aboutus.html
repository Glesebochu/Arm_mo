              Welcome to Arm’mo, where we keep track of your meditation history. We understand that a significant
              challenge
              faced by many meditators is taining a regular and accurate record of their meditative
              experiences. <br><br>For this
              reason, we have implemented functional systems that automatically save and display all your meditation
              data
              at
              the
              click of a button.

              In addition to analyzing meditation data, Arm’mo also functions as a meditation guide. To
              achieve this, we have incorporated the grand meditation principles from "The Mind Illuminated" by Culadasa
              John,
              a
              magnificent book on meditation practice.

              As a result, the game's user interface (UI) features a very intuitive dialogue sequence that players can
              undertake
              to represent their conscious experience and focus their minds.

              This process applies the preparation and
              transition
              phases extensively discussed in the book. Players can also progress through the 10 stages of the road to
              mastery,
              with each stage considered mastered based on the player's performance. For more information on these
              phases
              and
              stages, click on the link below.

              In simple terms, Arm’mo is a digital ledger and meditation guide that enhances the transformative nature
              of
              each
              of your meditation sessions.
